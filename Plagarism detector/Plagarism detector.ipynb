    "Given that we want to divide the string into sub-segments with size z while still performing the hashing, the best approach will be to use a modification of the Rabin-Karp algorithm that performs comparisons of a string with a pattern and returns the index of the substring (while using the benefits of updating the hashing algorithm). Because we are performing rolling hashing, the hashing function has to be continuous; thus, I modified the hashing table and used the rolling hash the helper function that will insert the value of the string (to perform comparisons in case that it was a collision and not the same actual value when the comparisons are made) and the index (so I could return the tuple with teh proper information, without the need to repeat the same calculation; because we know the index of the list in which value is it doesn't increase the time complexity of the search function significantly). \n",
    "For the hashing table size (taking into account that we would want to minimize the size, to use less memory while also minimizing the number of collisions and thus the time complexity), so to determine the size, the function divides the length of the string by the size of the substring to obtain the number of buckets we would need if it was a perfect fit and multiplying it by a prime number (thus allowing that the prime number increases the probabilities of a hash table that will include all the indexes, and given that we use the same value for q, creates unique divisions). As mentioned before, the value q uses the same size as the length of the table because q determines the index on the table; thus, we want it to be as spread out in the table as possible (e.g., using the strings \"x= \"hellothisisatest\" and y = \"yepevenifitchangesitsatest\" with k = 3, when the q value is a single prime number like 7 the collisions are 12, but when we determine q on a case by case bases using the hash table size as a reference, q = table size, we reduce the collisions to 2.\n",
    "To create the hash table itself, I modified the hash table \"skeleton\" provided in the reading so it would fit my particular use when the input was the already hash table. I decided to use the chaining method when dealing with collisions (i.e., using a linked list to store values with the same key) because even when it can increase the time complexity when there are multiple collisions, we don't need to resize the table (which is particularly problematic because our q value is dependent on the table size) and as long we keep the loading factor relatively low; it will be more effective than probing (which requires multiple extra operations to determine which slots of the table are still free). It is written as a class so I can reuse it for the other hashing methods(thus reducing the amount of repetitive code).\n"

    "The main differences between this code and the one above are the separation of the hashing function and the division of the string into substring into two functions, and the modification of the hashing algorithm. The creation of two different functions makes it easier to reutilize the code (especially considering that any other implementation would have to calculate the full hash of the substring, in contrast with the \"update\" of the rolling hash), only needing to change the type of hashing. In this case, I decided to go for a \"mid-square\" hashing function (with some slight modifications of the more common implementation); I used the total sum of the ordinal value of teh letters componing the string as the seed, and then I square that number, select the three middle digits, square that value again to get the hashed key. This hashing function (just as the one before) comes with the weakness that permutations of a word will cause collisions (given the use of the total sum as the seed); however, it's faster implementation and calculation in comparison with some more thorough hashing functions make it functional for a plagiarism detector. This function does not need a q value because all the hashed keys will have the same lengths (beneficial for standardizing the output, that lead to easier storage and identification in other implementations, as a basic low encryption password storage, but it's not that relevant for the table, in fact, it can increase the number of collisions given that all the numbers will have the same range just by their size (from 100 to 999)). Because we know the range of all the hashing keys, we know that our table will only need to have 1000 elements, and the use of a linked list helps us mitigate the collisions (at the expense of increasing the time complexity).

    "The only change between this implementation and the above is the change in the hashing function. Here I implemented md5 (with the addition of adding the mod of every character to get an integer), a secure hash, to minimize the number of collisions. However, the reduction happens at the cost of efficiency given that md5 is more computationally expensive, and the output will be longer; thus, the table size has to increase. To relate teh size of the table to the input, while still trying to fit all the substrings, I raise the lengths of the string by the number of substrings if we divided by 3 (creating a big number of subdivisions, and multiply by 10000 to guarantee that we will be able to index every hashed key.

    "Because we want to use our code to build an algorithm that could negatively affect the lives of the people that uses it, it's crucial that we specify what our algorithm does to explain the interpretation of the results and the impact that it can have. We know that when an algorithm produces a result in a \"trial\" setting, even when it's not the sole determinant for the verdict, it will influence the result of the people that will give it (Christin et al., n.d.), given their \"unbiased\" and purely objective appearance; however, there is influence by the people how to design them. Our code, like any other, it's not perfect, briefly mention before none of the non-encrypted hashing functions can differentiate between permutations of the same word, so the algorithm can have a slight upward bias towards plagiarism (depending on the size of the substring analyzed, considering that the probability of permutations increases as k decreases). In a real-world application, we would need to measure the percentage of words (i.e., substrings in our case) in the string x that match the substrings in y, so to lower the plagiarism score when it can be a coincidence, we would need to process the string before and remove all the common words (assuming that we are analyzing teh similarity between strings in teh same language), i.e., the conjunctions, (e.g., the, so, because, etc.) so if there's a high likelihood of the same words in teh same frequency the probability that its real plagiarism and not a coincidence increases. Because our plagiarism detector can create bias in evaluations, we can create different tiers or thresholds in which it can communicate the information to the user without using the word plagiarism (e.,g we can use the word match that has a less negative connotation). It's also important to mention that another weakness of our plagiarism detector (only guiding us by the structures above) it's that it can't detect when the \"match substring\" forms part of a quote, so if we are evaluated against a dataset, it will treat cited and uncited uses the same, when we know proper citations don't count as plagiarism.\n",
    "Our code can only identify similar patterns, but it cannot detect and, as mentioned repeatedly, if those patterns were a coincidence, instructions for the assignment, etc., so communicating that our code (especially given its simplicity) can't be used to be the sole judge of plagiarism, it can be a step to determine which works could be plagiarised to guide an evaluator to further review those works (knowing that the flag already creates some bias that it's trying to be mitigated); another way to see it is that it's not an indicator of absolute probability, it provides evidence for a bayesian analysis for teh likelihood of plagiarism of work, under the particular conditions of the assignment.

    "Time complexity analysis of rolling hash\n",
    "\n",
    "The main parts that form the rolling hash function are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The construction of the hash table/Inserting and searching: After analyzing the load factor and determining that it is less than 1, we can say that the average time that it will take to O(1), to perform the insertion and the search. This time complexity comes as a result of the low likelihood of collisions, which are the main factor in increasing the time complexity of the table itself. If the load factor was bigger (i.e., > 1), the collisions would use higher amounts of the linked lists the insertion and search could increase to O(n), performing significantly worst.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Divide the substrings and hashing: The division into sublists requires us to go thru each element of the list to get teh subdivisions of size k, so our time complexity will be O(n), where n represents the length of the string we are evaluating, for x and for y because they are done independently. However, the big determinant of the time complexity of the function is how the hashing function; the use of rolling hashing allows us to save time by avoiding needing the rehash the whole string (i.e., using teh analogy of dynamic programming where the repeated results are stored, here the previous computation is stored and used to perform the following ones, thus reducing the time complexity). Given that the update is only a mathematical operation (that is, inside the for loop use used to calculate the O(n) for the subdivisions), we still use the O(n) for the total time complexity. Even when we know that inside this function, the insertion to the hashing table is called for each value subdivisions, given the previously established value of O(1) for the search and the insertion, we can consider it as a constant (that asymptotically would generate the big-O that we established before, and it's not dependant on the value of the input). \n",
    "\n",
    "Compared with the usual Rabin-Karp algorithm (that requires the comparison inside the function), and has a time complexity of O(mn) where m is the length of the pattern is compared to (k in our case), and n the length of the string, we reduce it to O(n) by performing the comparison thru a hash table. Taking everything into consideration and knowing that the hashing happens for both strings, our time complexity is O(x) + O(y) + O(1) (where x and y represent the length of the respective strings). Thus the time complexity would depend on the longer string (i.e., simplified, it would still be O(n))\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the regular hashing, performed with a \"mid-square\" hashing function, the hash table has the same time complexity (given that we used the same code). The calculation of teh time complexity is dependant on the divisions of the other functions; the division of the string into substrings is still O(n), however, know to hash the substring, we would need to call the \"mid-hash\" function, that is dependant on the length of the substring (that by the definition of our code, we know it is k, and that will need to be calculated from scratch for each substring), giving us a time complexity of O(nk) (even when the mid square function calls the function to find the 3 middle numbers, it only has operations that are independent on the input so we can omit it given the time complexity of O(1)); This time complexity of O(nk), means that if n==k the time complexity will be O(n^2) representing the worst scenario for the function. Just as before or total time complexity becomes: O(xk) + O(yk) + O(1), that asymptotically will behave as O(nk).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental analysis shows that as suggested by their respective time complexity analysis, the \"mid-square\" hashing will have a higher time complexity; however, it's important to note two things. First, the value of k remains constant throughout the analysis, trying to maintain a small enough length for the substring (intended to maximize the number of buckets in the hash table while maintaining k as a value that could represent a bigger number of words than words with only 2 letters for example) and the values of x and y will have the same length. Second, that rolling hash had a bigger number of collisions than teh mid-square hash, but still performed the comparisons faster and given the calculation of the size of the table had a lower loading value, so the decision on which hashing algorithm to use will depend on the priorities of the problem.\n"

In the context of the code, I altered the Rabin-Karp algorithm to maximize its advantages, like the faster hashing calculation due to updating, and mitigate some of its downside (switching to a hash table vs. direct comparison to reduce the time complexity). \n",

    "Looking back at the beginning of the semester, my understanding of what LO implies has grown, which is particularly obvious with the #complexityanalysis LO. At the beginning of the semester, I didn't have a clear understanding of what the LO entailed, but as the time progressed, I started to understand the nuances, like understanding recursive relationships, analyzing teh time complexity from the code (taking into account the functions inside a function, a concept that I somewhat struggled to fully analyzed until later on in the semester), and understand that even its important to understand it will not give you the full information for the code and different context might prioritize different benefits (e.g., space complexity). Overall, the LO's helped me to gain the basics to better understand computational concepts that will help me optimize future code and applications. "
