    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Auto-completion functionalities are now ubiquitous in search engines, document editors, and messaging apps. How would you go about developing an algorithmic strategy from scratch to implement these computational solutions? In this assignment, you will learn about a new data structure and use it to build a very simple auto-complete engine. Each question in the assignment guides you closer to that objective while encouraging you to contrast this novel data structure to the other ones we have discussed in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [trie tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie), or a prefix tree, is a common data structure that stores a set of strings in a collection of nodes so that all strings with a common prefix are found in the same branch of the tree. Each node is associated with a letter, and as you traverse down the tree, you pick up more letters, eventually forming a word. Complete words are commonly found on the leaf nodes. However, some inner nodes can also mark full words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s use an example diagram to illustrate several important features of tries:\n",
    "\n",
    "![tries01.png](attachment:tries01.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nodes that mark valid words are marked in yellow. Notice that while all leaves are considered valid words, only some inner nodes contain valid words, while some remain only prefixes to valid words appearing down the branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The tree does not have to be balanced, and the height of different branches depends on its contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In our implementation, branches never merge to show common suffixes (for example, both ANT and ART end in T, but these nodes are kept separate in their respective branches). However, this is a common first line of memory optimization for tries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first node contains an empty string; it “holds the tree together.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task in this assignment will be to implement a functional trie tree. You will be able to insert words into a dictionary, lookup valid and invalid words, print your dictionary in alphabetical order, and suggest appropriate suffixes like an auto-complete bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment questions will guide you through these tasks one by one. To stay safe from breaking your own code, and to reinforce the idea of code versioning, under each new question first **copy your previous (working) code**, and only then **implement the new feature**. The code skeletons provided throughout will make this easier for you at the cost of repeating some large portions of code."

    "## Q1: Implement a trie tree\n",
    "\n",
    "In this question, you will write Python code that can take a set/list/tuple of strings and insert them into a trie tree and lookup whether a specific word/string is present in the trie tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q1a: Theoretical pondering\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main approaches to building trees, you might recall from class, are making separate Tree and Node classes, or only making a Node class. Which method do you think is a better fit for trie trees, and why? **Justify your reasoning in around 100 words.** You will use your chosen approach throughout the assignment, so don't rush this question."

    "Even when both approaches work, using two separate classes has the two big advantages of treating each node as its own object, thus allowing the inclusion of attributes for each node (in this case, each character), and it allows for more efficient maintenance of the structure regardless of the input.\n",
    "Being able to treat each character as their own object allows the inclusion of attributes that will facilitate the implementation (and readability of the code), like the children of the node and instead of needing to add an extra node signaling the end of the word (i.e., the color of the node in the overview), the node itself can have the attribute indicating the need of the word. It also facilitates the addition of new attributes if they are necessary for a new method in the trie class.\n",
    "Because we are dealing with characters depending on other characters, the best way to store them is in dictionaries, which means that the root will need to also be stored in a dictionary. If we only deal with a single class, the manipulation of the root would need to be done there, meaning we will need to be especially careful of adding some sentinel value to guarantee the running of the code, and because it depends on the structure of the other nodes if you wanted to add extra attributes, depending on how it's implemented it could affect the whole code. On the other hand, having the root in the Trie class guarantees that the function can always be called (even if no nodes are inserted), and the structure of the tree will remain (even if we manipulate the node class). However, as a drawback, this approach of two classes can take more memory (given the stored information for each node).\n",

The first one checks for an empty word, a case that was especially tough thru because it represents the \"character\" of the root node (being able to easily change the attributes of a specific node is one of the advantages of having two classes). The second and third tests deal with the insertion function; because the tree is already initialized, we can add new words using the insert method; the second test checks that after inserting a new word, the original words used to initialize the tree weren't impacted, while the third one checks that the lookup function only recognizes the word after actually being inserted. The fourth test finally checks for the special character of the word, assuming that a special character signifies a different word (i.e., the word would be in the tree if it had the special character). The fifth and final test checks the condition of the root again, but when the tree was initialized with an empty list.\n",

Both of them evaluate the children of the root and determine if the first character of the word matches, then it continues down until it has the whole word or returns False. The difference between the two is that the insert method converts the missing characters into nodes (we are going to assume it takes constant time), while search has to iterate through the existing children of the root to determine if the word is the trie. In the worst-case, both functions would need to transverse thru the length of the word to determine if its actually in the tree, leading to the time complexity of O(L), where L is the length of the said word (i.e., doesn't need to iterate thru the whole tree because only care about a perfect match, and all the words in a child start with the same character). In terms of memory, the search operation only takes O(1), which is the requirement of searching (but no new elements are added), while inserting could take a memory of O(L) if none of the characters of the word were already added to the tree. \n",

Because the time complexity of tries depends on the length of the word in comparison with the total number of elements in the tree (BST), the difference in time complexities will be more evident the more elements the tree has, dramatically increasing the time of the BST but not of the trie. \n"

    "###### Approach justification\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that I have two classes, I can store information about each node, providing information on the node itself when to stop (by determining the color of the node and if it, in fact, has children). This advantage allows for the use of recursion to a branch of the trie, consecutively calling the children of the node that is being examined. However, to traverse the entire tree, we need to call each starting letter (i.e., the first node being examined), which requires an iteration through each child of the root node. This means that to recurse through the tree, I used a mix of both approaches, implementing the advantage of two classes by using the information stored in each node while requiring some sort of iteration to guarantee the traversing of every possible word. \n",
    "\n",
    "######  Test Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "To guarantee the correct implementation of the order list, I created four more tests. The first examines the possibility of an empty list, and trivially it should return an empty list; this test guarantees that the new method doesn't affect the structure of the original trie tree. The second test's input is repeated words, and because it doesn't have a word counter, it should return the list without the repetition (which it does). The third test examines special characters to determine if the method can handle them (and as a convention of alphabetical order assigned them after the letter without special characters). The fourth and final test rechecks the handling of words with the same prefix, guaranteeing that all of them are present in the correct order. \n",

    "\n",
    "To mathematically determine the overall connotation of a speech, you might want to compute which words are most frequently used and then run a [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis). To this end, add a method to your code, **k_most_common()** that will take as an input k, an integer, and return a list of the k most common words from the dictionary within the trie. The structure of the output list should be such that each entry is a tuple, the first element being the word and the second an integer of its frequency (see docstring if you’re confused).\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this exercise, you don’t have to bother with resolving ties (for example, if k = 1, but there are two most common words with the same frequency, you can return either of them), but consider it an extra challenge and let us know if you believe you managed to solve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test cell below downloads and preprocesses several real-world speeches, and then runs the k-most-common word analysis of them; your code should pass the tests. As usual, add at least **three more tests**, and justify why they are relevant to your code (feel free to find more speeches to start analysing too!).\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, copy-paste your previous code and make adjustments to this \"new version\". The first cell has been locked to stop you from accidentally deleting the docstrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Completing this question well will help you to tackle Q5!\n",
    "\n",
    "*(Hint: This task will probably require your nodes to store more information about the frequency of words inserted into the tree. One data structure that might be very useful to tackle the problem of traversing the tree and finding most common words is heaps — you are allowed to use the heapq library or another alternative for this task.)*"

If the string is not present in the tree, the output will be the same as the input. However, if the string is present in the tree, your task is to find the most common word to which it is a prefix and return that word instead (this can still turn out to be itself).\n",

Your autocomplete should then pass the following tests. As usual, add at least **three more test cases**, and explain why they are appropriate (you can use input other than Shakespeare for them).\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to include a minimum **100 word-summary critically evaluating** your autocomplete engine. How does it really work? Your critical reflection needs to specifically evaluate the role of the different data structures used by their algorithm and what is the overall complexity that the algorithm offers. Can we do better? If so, how and by how much?\n",

    "*This is a thoroughly frequentist approach to the problem, which is not the only method, and in many cases not the ideal method. However, if you were tasked with implementing something like [this](https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/) or [this](https://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/autocomplete/), it might just be enough, so let’s give it a go. Good luck!*"

    "- .lookpup(), because we need to find the position of the end of the prefix, I created a modification of the search method above, that instead of returning a boolean, it returns the last node of the prefix. This operation, just as the lookup, has a time complexity of O(pL), where pL is the length of the prefix.\n",
    "- .lower(), given that there’s no definite answer in the documentation about its time complexity, I will assume the worst (given that I’m evaluating the upper bound), and said O(pL) where the function would iterate through each character of the word to change its case.\n",
    "- preorder_transversal(), this method (in the context of the autocomplete function )transverse to the node child (and the subsequent children of those children) of the last node of the prefix (i.e., the whole branch after the end of the prefix), to find all the possible words; this function leads to a time complexity of O(h * w), where h represents the average height/length of the suffix of the words that share the same prefix, and w represents the number of words/children in that particular branch. \n",
    "- Selection of the most repeated. This part of the function only requires selecting the first element of a list (already sorted by other methods), leading to time complexity of O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s important to mention that I’m assuming that the insertion and other methods are not counted, given that we want to determine the time complexity only of the autocomplete function. The other methods will significantly increase the time; for example, the construction of the trie takes approximately O(ws*l), where ws is the number of words added, and l is the average length of said words, thus requiring us to count for every node in the tree (which is not necessary for the autocomplete function). \n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us an overall time complexity of:\n",
    "\n",
    "-                                      O (w log w) + O(pL) + O(pL) + O(h * w) + O(1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the time complexity will take the value of the biggest time complexity (due to the asymptotic behavior of big-O); this will mean that in the worst case (assuming long words and a lot of them), of O(h * w). The final decision comes to either O(h * w) or O (w log w), but given that the second one multiplies logarithmically and we are assuming that the longs are long and many (worst possible case), h*w will be bigger as the input (and length of each word of the input) increases\n",

    "###### Time complexity: O(h * w)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that to improve the time of the method, we would need to reduce the search time of traversing each branch. One way to do this could be combining it with a divide and conquer approach (e.g., merge sort) where each sub-branch (i.e., could be looked at simultaneously), reducing the time to approximately h* log w (i.e., using the same approach of merge sort algorithms would lead to a reduction of the total words because they would be evaluated simultaneously; a drawback could be the increased memory usage). It’s also important to mention that the transversion is done recursively, which is known for taking more time than recursion, so if we could change the approach while keeping the advantage of the information stored in the nodes, the transversion would be reduced. Even when it’s not the biggest component of the time complexity, in this case, the sorting of the full list is not crucial; we could use a max function and only compare if two methods have the same number of repetitions or determine their alphabetical order.\n"

    "- #breakitdown: The final question is the conclusion of all the questions that came before. Building the Shakespeare dictionary required the breakdown of the problem (and functionality of the trie), which was done in detail by the previous questions. This question required first constructing the trie, then understanding who could traverse it and all the possible functions that it could have, to finally combine it all together in a functional autocomplete. The decomposition provided a deeper analysis and understanding, facilitating the final result. \n",
